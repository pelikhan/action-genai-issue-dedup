# action action

This script checks if an issue is a duplicate of another issue in the same repository.

## Inputs

- `github_token`: GitHub token with `models: read` permission at least. (required)
- `github_issue`: GitHub issue number to use when generating comments.
- `debug`: Enable debug logging.

## Outputs

- `text`: The generated text output.
- `data`: The generated JSON data output, parsed and stringified.

## Usage

Add the following to your step in your workflow file:

```yaml
uses: pelikhan/action-genai-issue-dedup@main
with:
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  github_issue: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
```

## Example

```yaml
name: Find Duplicate Issues
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
permissions:
  contents: read
  models: read
  issues: write
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  genai-issue-dedup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run action-issue-dedup Action
        uses: pelikhan/action-genai-issue-dedup@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          github_issue: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
```

## Development

This action was automatically generated by GenAIScript from the script metadata.
We recommend updating the script metadata instead of editing the action files directly.

- the action inputs are inferred from the script parameters
- the action outputs are inferred from the script output schema
- the action description is the script title
- the readme description is the script description
- the action branding is the script branding

To **regenerate** the action files (`action.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`), run:

```bash
npm run configure
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This will overwrite any changes you made to these files!

To lint script files, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To typecheck the scripts, run:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

To build the Docker image locally, run:
```bash
npm run docker:build
```

To run the action locally in Docker (build it first), use:
```bash
npm run docker:start
```

To run the action using [act](https://nektosact.com/), first install the act CLI:

```bash
npm run act:install
```

Then, you can run the action with:

```bash
npm run act
```

## Upgrade

The GenAIScript version is pinned in the `package.json` file. To upgrade it, run:

```bash
npm run upgrade
```
